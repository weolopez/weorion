Next Steps: Making the Game Fun & Complete
Phase 6: Core Game Loop & State Management
This phase establishes the basic win/loss conditions, scoring, and progression.

Scoring System:

File: https://www.google.com/search?q=games/asteroids/js/main.js or GameManager.js
Task: Add a score variable to track the player's points.
Details:
Increment score when the player or their projectile destroys an Asteroid or EnemySpaceship. Assign points based on the type/size of the destroyed object (e.g., larger asteroids/enemies give more points).
Add a method to GameObject or handle in the collision response to trigger score updates (gameManager.addScore(points)).
Player Lives and Game Over:

File: https://www.google.com/search?q=games/asteroids/js/spaceship.js, https://www.google.com/search?q=games/asteroids/js/main.js or GameManager.js
Task: Add a lives variable for the player and implement game over logic.
Details:
Add a lives property to the player Spaceship instance or the GameManager.
When the player's health reaches zero, decrement lives.
Implement a player respawn mechanism (potentially with temporary invulnerability, like the shield).
If lives reaches zero, transition to a GAME_OVER state.
Implement a game state machine (e.g., TITLE_SCREEN, PLAYING, GAME_OVER, PAUSED) in main.js or GameManager.js to control which logic runs and what is drawn.
Basic UI Display:

File: https://www.google.com/search?q=games/asteroids/js/main.js
Task: Draw essential game information on the canvas.
Details:
Use ctx.fillText() or similar to display the player's current score, lives, and potentially shieldTimer status. Position these elements clearly on the screen, perhaps in corners or a dedicated UI area.
Initial Wave/Challenge Structure:

File: https://www.google.com/search?q=games/asteroids/js/main.js or GameManager.js
Task: Implement a basic system to spawn enemies/asteroids and increase difficulty.
Details:
Start the game with an initial set of asteroids and perhaps a few basic enemies.
When all (or a significant portion) of the current enemies/asteroids are destroyed, trigger the start of the next "wave".
Each wave should increase the number of spawned entities, potentially introduce faster or tougher enemies/asteroids, or spawn them closer to the player.
Phase 7: Visual and Audio Feedback
Add polish through sound effects and visual cues.

Sound Effects:

File: Create games/asteroids/js/AudioManager.js or similar.
Task: Load and play sound effects for key game events.
Details:
Source or create sound effects for: Player shooting (different sounds for laser/plasma), enemy shooting, hits/damage taken (player and enemies), explosions (different sizes), power-up collection, shield activation/deactivation, player respawn, game over.
Add methods to the AudioManager (or directly in relevant classes/GameManager) to play sounds at the appropriate time.
Ensure sounds don't overlap excessively (basic pooling or limiting concurrent plays if needed).
Background Music:

File: AudioManager.js or main.js
Task: Add background music that plays during the PLAYING state.
Details:
Load a music track and play it in a loop when the game state is PLAYING.
Visual Effects (Basic Particles/Animations):

File: Could be separate ParticleSystem.js or integrated into GameObject.js / specific entity classes.
Task: Add visual flair for events.
Details:
Explosions: When an object is destroyed, create a temporary visual effect (e.g., expanding rings, scattering particles) at its location.
Shield: Improve the shield visual when active (a translucent or shimmering effect).
Weapon Fire: Simple muzzle flash or particle trail for projectiles.
Add these effects to the main entity list, managing their lifespan.
Phase 8: Expanding Content & Polish
Introduce more variety and improve the overall user experience.

Asteroids:
Should be of different shapes and sizes
Should have collision and damage to ships
Should break up to smaller asteroids

More Power-up Types:

File: Create new classes inheriting from PowerUp.js.
Task: Design and implement 1-2 new power-up types.
Examples:
Weapon Upgrade: Temporarily switch to the Plasma Weapon, or increase fire rate of current weapon.
Speed Boost: Temporarily increase player's max speed and acceleration.
Details:
Create classes like WeaponUpgradePowerUp.js, SpeedBoostPowerUp.js.
Implement their applyEffect(spaceship) method to modify player properties.
Add logic to Spaceship.update() to handle the duration and expiration of these temporary effects.
Add these new power-ups to the random spawning logic (e.g., from destroyed asteroids/enemies).
Refine AI Behaviors:

File: https://www.google.com/search?q=games/asteroids/js/AIController.js or within EnemySpaceship.js
Task: Add slightly different AI tendencies for varied enemy types.
Details:
While flanking is good, maybe some enemy types have a KAMIKAZE state where they just charge the player.
Others could try to keep distance (KITING state).
Small tweaks to flanking logic (e.g., how close they get, how aggressively they shoot).
Tie these behaviors to the aiBehavior property in the sprites.js definitions.
Game States and Basic Menus:

File: https://www.google.com/search?q=games/asteroids/js/main.js
Task: Implement simple title and game over screens.
Details:
In the TITLE_SCREEN state, draw a title and instructions (e.g., "Press Space to Start"). Wait for player input to transition to PLAYING.
In the GAME_OVER state, display "Game Over", the final score, and instructions (e.g., "Press R to Restart"). Wait for input to transition back to TITLE_SCREEN or restart the game loop.
Implement a PAUSED state triggered by pressing 'P' or 'Escape'.
Ongoing Refinement
As you work through these steps, remember to:

Test Thoroughly: After adding each feature, play the game extensively to catch bugs and balance issues.
Balance: Adjust values like weapon damage, fire rates, enemy health, speed, and shield duration to make the gameplay feel fair and challenging.
Code Organization: Continue to keep your code clean, using separate files for different classes and concerns.
Performance: Keep an eye on frame rate as you add more entities and effects. Optimize drawing and update logic if needed.
